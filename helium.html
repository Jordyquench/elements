			<h1>─── HELIUM ───</h1>
			<p>The first element we're going to be learning about is Helium (He), It is the first of the noble gases, the first place scientists discovered helium was on the sun! </p>
			<p>Helium is quite similar to some other elements because it is found as a gas and has no smell or colour. It is a very popular element, this is becasue it is found everywhere, it makes up a small part of the air that you breathe.</p>

				<p>If you get a balloon thats filled with helium and inhale it your voice will go really high and you will sound squeaky. It is dangerous to do though.</p>
